Here is a list of 50 cool project ideas that you could build in 2021. I will even give you my technical stack as an example so you can figure out how you could do it too. These applications can be on the web, mobile and desktop. There is an unlimited choice of tools, technologies and programming languages that you could use to build them I am only showing some use cases here. Each project has a programming level of either beginner, intermediate or advanced. And these applications are created to be either front-end, back-end or full-stack.</p>\n\n<p>My current technical stack is:</p>\n\n<p>Front-End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, React Native, Redux, Flutter/Dart<br>\nBack-End: Python, Node.Js, SQL, NoSQL</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"1-social-media-dashboard\" href=\"#1-social-media-dashboard\">\n  </a>\n  1. Social Media Dashboard\n</h2>\n\n<p>This could be an app that combines many social media networks into one interface. So for example you could have Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram all together. That means only having one browser tab opened and one unified user interface.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Programming Level</strong>: Advanced<br>\n<strong>Project Type</strong>: Full-Stack   </p>\n\n<p><strong>Front-End</strong>: HTML, CSS, TypeScript, React, Redux, React Native<br>\n<strong>Back-End</strong>: Node.Js, NoSQL</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"2-dating-app-manager\" href=\"#2-dating-app-manager\">\n  </a>\n  2. Dating App Manager\n</h2>\n\n<p>An app that would make it easy for you to manage your dating life. Because these days many people tend to use multiple dating apps so it can be hard for you to keep track of the dates you have planned. With this type of app you could keep track of all of the people you are currently talking to as well as basic information such as names, phone numbers, where you met etc...</p>\n\n<p><strong>Programming Level</strong>: Intermediate<br>\n<strong>Project Type</strong>: Full-Stack</p>\n\n<p><strong>Front-End</strong>: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, React Native<br>\n<strong>Back-End</strong>: Node.Js, NoSQL</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"3-computer-game-companion-app\" href=\"#3-computer-game-companion-app\">\n  </a>\n  3. Computer Game Companion App\n</h2>\n\n<p>With this type of app you could essentially take your gaming experience with you. For example if you play a game like Fortnite you could build a mobile app that lets you track your stats. You could even have an inventory section for all of the emotes, weapons and accessories.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Programming Level</strong>: Intermediate<br>\n<strong>Project Type</strong>: Full-Stack</p>\n\n<p><strong>Front-End</strong>: HTML, CSS, TypeScript, React, React Native<br>\n<strong>Back-End</strong>: Node.Js, NoSQL</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"4-job-search-app\" href=\"#4-job-search-app\">\n  </a>\n  4. Job Search App\n</h2>\n\n<p>How about creating a job search app that feels more like a dating app instead of the traditional serious looking job boards out there. So instead of doing the usual boring job application where you have to submit your CV and then wait for a generic email telling you that they received your application and will get back to you. You are instead given the ability to swipe if you think it's a match or not if you do not think so. Interaction with the hiring manager would feel so much more informal and casual. But of course there should be a way to limit interactions so it does not feel like spam and get overwhelming.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Programming Level</strong>: Intermediate<br>\n<strong>Project Type</strong>: Full-Stack</p>\n\n<p><strong>Front-End</strong>: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, React Native<br>\n<strong>Back-End</strong>: Node.Js, NoSQL</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"5-100daysofcode-app\" href=\"#5-100daysofcode-app\">\n  </a>\n  5. 100DaysOfCode App\n</h2>\n\n<p>The 100DaysOfCode challenge helps people to commit to learning how to code consistently. Basically you just use the hashtag for 100DaysOfCode and then use Twitter to tweet your daily progress. At the moment there is no easy way to automatically keep track and schedule tweets for the hashtag. So you creating an app that automatically schedules the tweets as well as any media attached would be quite useful.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Programming Level</strong>: Intermediate<br>\n<strong>Project Type</strong>: Full-Stack</p>\n\n<p><strong>Front-End</strong>: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Flutter/Dart<br>\n<strong>Back-End</strong>: Node.Js, SQL</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"6-social-network-for-mental-health\" href=\"#6-social-network-for-mental-health\">\n  </a>\n  6. Social Network for Mental Health\n</h2>\n\n<p>This global pandemic has affected almost everyone's mental health in some way or form. Creating a safe place where people can talk about it and share stories would be great. It's a way for people to get stuff off their chest while also connecting with people who can relate to their issues.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Programming Level</strong>: Intermediate<br>\n<strong>Project Type</strong>: Full-Stack</p>\n\n<p><strong>Front-End</strong>: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Flutter/Dart<br>\n<strong>Back-End</strong>: Node.Js, SQL</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"7-professional-singer-audio-app\" href=\"#7-professional-singer-audio-app\">\n  </a>\n  7. Professional Singer Audio App\n</h2>\n\n<p>How about developing an app that lets the average person sing a song which is then enhanced so that it makes you sound like a professional singer? It could also have its own social network so that you can share original songs and albums.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Programming Level</strong>: Advanced<br>\n<strong>Project Type</strong>: Full-Stack</p>\n\n<p><strong>Front-End</strong>: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Flutter/Dart<br>\n<strong>Back-End</strong>: Node.Js, SQL</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"8-fashion-design-app\" href=\"#8-fashion-design-app\">\n  </a>\n  8. Fashion Design App\n</h2>\n\n<p>Building a fashion design app that can create a personal style for you based on your personal choices and it gives you links to websites to purchase the clothing. With this concept it is essentially working as a personal style guide that works for you and gives you recommendations on what to buy which is fashionable for you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Programming Level</strong>: Intermediate<br>\n<strong>Project Type</strong>: Full-Stack</p>\n\n<p><strong>Front-End</strong>: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Flutter/Dart<br>\n<strong>Back-End</strong>: Node.Js, SQL</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"9-dating-life-community-app\" href=\"#9-dating-life-community-app\">\n  </a>\n  9. Dating Life Community App\n</h2>\n\n<p>Not everyone finds dating easy so how about building a dating life community app where people can talk and share resources on how to meet people and get into relationships. Talking about personal experiences as well as tips.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Programming Level</strong>: Intermediate<br>\n<strong>Project Type</strong>: Full-Stack</p>\n\n<p><strong>Front-End</strong>: HTML, CSS, TypeScript, React, React Native<br>\n<strong>Back-End</strong>: Node.Js, NoSQL</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"10-lost-animals-app\" href=\"#10-lost-animals-app\">\n  </a>\n  10. Lost Animals App\n</h2>\n\n<p>This is a cool idea you could develop an app that lets you tag a location of where you found a lost animal. With this kind of app you could potentially share the location with someone who has lost an animal so that they could find it. As an addition having the location of the nearest clinic nearby could make it even easier to take them some place safe.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Programming Level</strong>: Intermediate<br>\n<strong>Project Type</strong>: Full-Stack</p>\n\n<p><strong>Front-End</strong>: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Flutter/Dart<br>\n<strong>Back-End</strong>: Node.Js, SQL</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"11-a-review-website-aggregator\" href=\"#11-a-review-website-aggregator\">\n  </a>\n  11. A Review Website Aggregator\n</h2>\n\n<p>As developers it can sometimes be hard to find a good course because there are so many on the internet. So creating a review website aggregator that pulls in reviews from courses all over the internet would be amazing. You could filter and sort through the courses which would make it super easy to decide on a learning path.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Programming Level</strong>: Advanced<br>\n<strong>Project Type</strong>: Full-Stack</p>\n\n<p><strong>Front-End</strong>: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, React Native<br>\n<strong>Back-End</strong>: Node.Js, NoSQL</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"12-a-random-website-generator\" href=\"#12-a-random-website-generator\">\n  </a>\n  12. A Random Website Generator\n</h2>\n\n<p>Unless you have a design background it can be quite hard to come up with a design for an app or website. So with that in mind creating a random website generator would be very cool. In this case it would just put a design together which you could then build using the programming language of your choice. Or if you are feeling up for a challenge you could turn it into a full fledged website builder too that even generates the code!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Programming Level</strong>: Advanced<br>\n<strong>Project Type</strong>: Full-Stack   </p>\n\n<p><strong>Front-End</strong>: HTML, CSS, JavaScript<br>\n<strong>Back-End</strong>: Python, SQL</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"13-dating-app\" href=\"#13-dating-app\">\n  </a>\n  13. Dating App\n</h2>\n\n<p>The world is already full of dating apps but there is still no stand out app. They all have their pros and cons if you take a look at the reviews for them. So building a dating app that takes the best features of all apps while still remaining affordable or even free should persuade the masses to join.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Programming Level</strong>: Intermediate<br>\n<strong>Project Type</strong>: Full-Stack</p>\n\n<p><strong>Front-End</strong>: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, Flutter/Dart<br>\n<strong>Back-End</strong>: Node.Js, SQL</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"14-ecommerce-website\" href=\"#14-ecommerce-website\">\n  </a>\n  14. E-Commerce Website\n</h2>\n\n<p>Shopping websites are always in high demand as people will always have things to sell. Giving someone their own personal platform for selling custom products is a good thing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Programming Level</strong>: Intermediate<br>\n<strong>Project Type</strong>: Full-Stack</p>\n\n<p><strong>Front-End</strong>: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, Flutter/Dart<br>\n<strong>Back-End</strong>: Node.Js, NoSQL</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"15-random-meal-generator-app\" href=\"#15-random-meal-generator-app\">\n  </a>\n  15. Random Meal Generator App\n</h2>\n\n<p>Deciding on what to cook or eat can be hard sometimes. Creating an application that can randomly generate meals and choose ingredients that work well together could improve your cooking skills. You could also discover some nice recipes which you could share with people.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Programming Level</strong>: Beginner<br>\n<strong>Project Type</strong>: Front-End   </p>\n\n<p><strong>Front-End</strong>: HTML, CSS, JavaScript<br>\n<strong>Back-End</strong>: N/A</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"16-developer-freelance-platform\" href=\"#16-developer-freelance-platform\">\n  </a>\n  16. Developer Freelance Platform\n</h2>\n\n<p>Similar to websites like Upwork and Fiverr however it is a platform that is ONLY for developers. It could be a platform that makes it easy for developers to find and connect with each other and work on projects together through collaboration. So you are not only getting fast and easy real world experience but you are also connecting with developers who are around your skill level. This would be a fantastic way to level up and an easy way for beginners to get work. I think it would be a good idea as it cuts out the recruiter completely and you don't need to stress over interviews. However there could be some form of onboarding and maybe tests depending on the work and the developers who work on it. These can be free open source projects or there can be some salary involved.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Programming Level</strong>: Intermediate<br>\n<strong>Project Type</strong>: Full-Stack</p>\n\n<p><strong>Front-End</strong>: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, React Native<br>\n<strong>Back-End</strong>: Node.Js, NoSQL</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"17-tv-tracking-app\" href=\"#17-tv-tracking-app\">\n  </a>\n  17. TV Tracking App\n</h2>\n\n<p>This could be a simple app that just lets you plan what to watch during the week.

Shopping Inventory App\n</h2>\n\n<p>Many people typically use a spreadsheet for keeping track of purchases and shopping habits. It would be much better in an app form. So just imagine creating an app that lets you track the stuff you buy so you know when you are running low on stock and need to buy more of that product.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Programming Level</strong>: Beginner<br>\n<strong>Project Type</strong>: Front-End</p>\n\n<p><strong>Front-End</strong>: HTML, CSS, JavaScript<br>\n<strong>Back-End</strong>: N/A</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"19-heads-or-tails-app\" href=\"#19-heads-or-tails-app\">\n  </a>\n  19. Heads or Tails App\n</h2>\n\n<p>Because of this pandemic people are less likely to be carrying around loose change. Flipping a coin to make a decision has been around for years. Creating a Heads or Tails app should be fairly straightforward.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Programming Level</strong>: Beginner<br>\n<strong>Project Type</strong>: Front-End</p>\n\n<p><strong>Front-End</strong>: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flutter/Dart<br>\n<strong>Back-End</strong>: N/A</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"20-random-song-lyrics-generator-app\" href=\"#20-random-song-lyrics-generator-app\">\n  </a>\n  20. Random Song Lyrics Generator App\n</h2>\n\n<p>Ever wanted to create your own song? Well, maybe one day you could write something amazing because of an app you created! Having an app do all the hard work for you makes it almost too easy assuming the words rhyme and go well together. Worst case scenario you end up with a funny song that goes viral.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Programming Level</strong>: Beginner<br>\n<strong>Project Type</strong>: Front-End</p>\n\n<p><strong>Front-End</strong>: HTML, CSS, JavaScript<br>\n<strong>Back-End</strong>: N/A</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"21-random-meme-generator-app\" href=\"#21-random-meme-generator-app\">\n  </a>\n  21. Random Meme Generator App\n</h2>\n\n<p>We live for memes and they usually make us laugh or go viral. Making an app that can come up with some funny content could be pretty cool. Combining random text with images or even something that is animated would go a long way to stardom.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Programming Level</strong>: Beginner<br>\n<strong>Project Type</strong>: Front-End</p>\n\n<p><strong>Front-End</strong>: HTML, CSS, JavaScript<br>\n<strong>Back-End</strong>: N/A</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"22-series-and-movie-watchlist-api\" href=\"#22-series-and-movie-watchlist-api\">\n  </a>\n  22. Series and Movie Watchlist API\n</h2>\n\n<p>You could create an API that stores all of the series and movies that you watch.

Random Map Generator\n</h2>\n\n<p>Coming up with a design for a game map can be quite tedious what if you could automatically generate a map? It does not have to be anything complicate or even 3D for that matter. If you are just making a simple 2D side scrolling game or top down view game it is far less work to create.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Programming Level</strong>: Intermediate<br>\n<strong>Project Type</strong>: Front-End</p>\n\n<p><strong>Front-End</strong>: HTML, CSS, JavaScript<br>\n<strong>Back-End</strong>: N/A</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"24-random-joke-generator\" href=\"#24-random-joke-generator\">\n  </a>\n  24.

Mindfulness App\n</h2>\n\n<p>Staying positive is extremely important for our health and well-being. So making an app that stores our journal messages and as well as having the ability to do daily gratitude would make it essential. If you are familiar with the Law of Attraction then you could even use it for scripting too.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Programming Level</strong>: Intermediate<br>\n<strong>Project Type</strong>: Full-Stack</p>\n\n<p><strong>Front-End</strong>: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Flutter/Dart<br>\n<strong>Back-End</strong>: Node.Js, SQL</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"28-code-breaker-app\" href=\"#28-code-breaker-app\">\n  </a>\n  28.

One example of a chatbot you could create is one that keeps track of your daily tasks and gives you recommendations on how to improve productivity. So in one use case maybe you spent 3 hours programming and skipped doing laundry on that day because you were too busy. The chatbot could help you to get better at time management and possibly even use pomodoro.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Programming Level</strong>: Intermediate<br>\n<strong>Project Type</strong>: Full-Stack</p>\n\n<p><strong>Front-End</strong>: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, React Native<br>\n<strong>Back-End</strong>: Node.Js, NoSQL</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"34-game-library-app\" href=\"#34-game-library-app\">\n  </a>\n  34. Game Library App\n</h2>\n\n<p>These days many people have multiple game libraries on different platforms. Or maybe they have forgotten many games that they have played over the years because back then they did not track everything they played. A solution can be to create a game library app so you can store all of your game history. This can include the year, game, genre, platform etc... Even if you currently own it or if you sold it and whether it's digital or a physical copy. An app like this could be expanded even further if you can make it into more of a social network so you can follow other peoples game list and they can do the same.

Here is a list of 50 cool project ideas that you could build in 2021. I will even give you my technical stack as an example so you can figure out how you could do it too. These applications can be on the web, mobile and desktop. There is an unlimited choice of tools, technologies and programming languages that you could use to build them I am only showing some use cases here. Each project has a programming level of either beginner, intermediate or advanced. And these applications are created to be either front-end, back-end or full-stack.\n\nMy current technical stack is:\n\nFront-End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, React Native, Redux, Flutter/Dart\nBack-End: Python, Node.Js, SQL, NoSQL\n\n## 1. Social Media Dashboard\n\nThis could be an app that combines many social media networks into one interface. So for example you could have Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram all together. That means only having one browser tab opened and one unified user interface.\n\n__Programming Level__: Advanced\n__Project Type__: Full-Stack   \n\n__Front-End__: HTML, CSS, TypeScript, React, Redux, React Native\n__Back-End__: Node.Js, NoSQL\n\n## 2. Dating App Manager\n\nAn app that would make it easy for you to manage your dating life. Because these days many people tend to use multiple dating apps so it can be hard for you to keep track of the dates you have planned. With this type of app you could keep track of all of the people you are currently talking to as well as basic information such as names, phone numbers, where you met etc...\n\n__Programming Level__: Intermediate\n__Project Type__: Full-Stack\n\n__Front-End__: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, React Native\n__Back-End__: Node.Js, NoSQL\n\n## 3. Computer Game Companion App\n\nWith this type of app you could essentially take your gaming experience with you. For example if you play a game like Fortnite you could build a mobile app that lets you track your stats. You could even have an inventory section for all of the emotes, weapons and accessories.\n\n__Programming Level__: Intermediate\n__Project Type__: Full-Stack\n\n__Front-End__: HTML, CSS, TypeScript, React, React Native\n__Back-End__: Node.Js, NoSQL\n\n## 4. Job Search App\n\nHow about creating a job search app that feels more like a dating app instead of the traditional serious looking job boards out there. So instead of doing the usual boring job application where you have to submit your CV and then wait for a generic email telling you that they received your application and will get back to you. You are instead given the ability to swipe if you think it's a match or not if you do not think so. Interaction with the hiring manager would feel so much more informal and casual. But of course there should be a way to limit interactions so it does not feel like spam and get overwhelming.\n\n__Programming Level__: Intermediate\n__Project Type__: Full-Stack\n\n__Front-End__: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, React Native\n__Back-End__: Node.Js, NoSQL\n\n## 5. 100DaysOfCode App\n\nThe 100DaysOfCode challenge helps people to commit to learning how to code consistently. Basically you just use the hashtag for 100DaysOfCode and then use Twitter to tweet your daily progress. At the moment there is no easy way to automatically keep track and schedule tweets for the hashtag. So you creating an app that automatically schedules the tweets as well as any media attached would be quite useful.\n\n__Programming Level__: Intermediate\n__Project Type__: Full-Stack\n\n__Front-End__: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Flutter/Dart\n__Back-End__: Node.Js, SQL\n\n## 6. Social Network for Mental Health\n\nThis global pandemic has affected almost everyone's mental health in some way or form. Creating a safe place where people can talk about it and share stories would be great. It's a way for people to get stuff off their chest while also connecting with people who can relate to their issues.\n\n__Programming Level__: Intermediate\n__Project Type__: Full-Stack\n\n__Front-End__: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Flutter/Dart\n__Back-End__: Node.Js, SQL\n\n## 7.

You could filter and sort through the courses which would make it super easy to decide on a learning path.\n\n__Programming Level__: Advanced\n__Project Type__: Full-Stack\n\n__Front-End__: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, React Native\n__Back-End__: Node.Js, NoSQL\n\n## 12. A Random Website Generator\n\nUnless you have a design background it can be quite hard to come up with a design for an app or website. So with that in mind creating a random website generator would be very cool. In this case it would just put a design together which you could then build using the programming language of your choice. Or if you are feeling up for a challenge you could turn it into a full fledged website builder too that even generates the code!\n\n__Programming Level__: Advanced\n__Project Type__: Full-Stack   \n\n__Front-End__: HTML, CSS, JavaScript\n__Back-End__: Python, SQL\n\n## 13. Dating App\n\nThe world is already full of dating apps but there is still no stand out app. They all have their pros and cons if you take a look at the reviews for them.

Developer Freelance Platform\n\nSimilar to websites like Upwork and Fiverr however it is a platform that is ONLY for developers. It could be a platform that makes it easy for developers to find and connect with each other and work on projects together through collaboration. So you are not only getting fast and easy real world experience but you are also connecting with developers who are around your skill level. This would be a fantastic way to level up and an easy way for beginners to get work. I think it would be a good idea as it cuts out the recruiter completely and you don't need to stress over interviews. However there could be some form of onboarding and maybe tests depending on the work and the developers who work on it. These can be free open source projects or there can be some salary involved.\n\n__Programming Level__: Intermediate\n__Project Type__: Full-Stack\n\n__Front-End__: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, React Native\n__Back-End__: Node.Js, NoSQL\n\n## 17.

One example of a chatbot you could create is one that keeps track of your daily tasks and gives you recommendations on how to improve productivity. So in one use case maybe you spent 3 hours programming and skipped doing laundry on that day because you were too busy. The chatbot could help you to get better at time management and possibly even use pomodoro.\n\n__Programming Level__: Intermediate\n__Project Type__: Full-Stack\n\n__Front-End__: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, React Native\n__Back-End__: Node.Js, NoSQL\n\n## 34. Game Library App\n\nThese days many people have multiple game libraries on different platforms. Or maybe they have forgotten many games that they have played over the years because back then they did not track everything they played. A solution can be to create a game library app so you can store all of your game history. This can include the year, game, genre, platform etc... Even if you currently own it or if you sold it and whether it's digital or a physical copy. An app like this could be expanded even further if you can make it into more of a social network so you can follow other peoples game list and they can do the same. The possibilities are endless.\n\n__Programming Level__: Intermediate\n__Project Type__: Full-Stack\n\n__Front-End__: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, React Native\n__Back-End__: Node.Js, NoSQL\n\n## 35.
