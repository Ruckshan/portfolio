Example: If you know <code>Angular</code>, <code>React</code> skill then its not necessary that you should know <code>Vue</code> or <code>Svelte</code>. Be Focused in your field,  <code>front end</code> or <code>backend</code> or <code>full stack developer</code> , do research on Job market and  focus on set of tools necessary for the Job. </li>\n<li>Don't compare yourself with other engineers career progress and get demotivated INSTEAD be good at your skills which helps you to get the Job done.</li>\n<li>After 8 hours of work, avoid using tech gadgets again to check mails etc, INSTEAD  give relax to you mind, take rest for sometime. </li>\n<li>Work is work, your health is important than work. Programming is not everything, give importance to other parts of life like friends, family, spend time with them.</li>\n<li>Taking rest can help you think sharp and be focused in the Job. Every 1 hour go for 5 min walk to avoid health issues. Every 20 min look away from screen to keep your eyes healthy.</li>\n<li>Avoid imposter syndrome by saying: am i good developer ?, can i learn that new skill ? , can i make it in this field ? Avoid these questions instead take this as motivation to learn necessary skills for the Job. </li>\n<li>No one can become the best developer in the world, but all can become decent developer by contributing to workplace . Becoming better developer is a journey but NOT a 3 months crash course.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a class=\"comment-mentioned-user\" href=\"https://dev.to/ben\">@ben</a>\n this advice should added in Welcome mail when user joins <code>DEV</code> and promotional mails.</p>\n\n\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p><a class=\"comment-mentioned-user\" href=\"https://dev.to/raphael_jambalos\">@raphael_jambalos</a>\n offers some wisdom in the comments of a post about what it's like being a <a href=\"https://dev.to/abdulbasit313/5-mistakes-i-wish-i-didn-t-make-as-a-self-taught-developer-gjk\">self-taught developer.</a> It's awesome to see such helpful advice being shared across the DEV community.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"liquid-comment\">\n    <div class=\"details\">\n      <a href=\"/raphael_jambalos\">\n        <img class=\"profile-pic\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DWHUxEY3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Pg0YmpWh--/c_fill%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_50%2Cq_auto%2Cw_50/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/profile_image/73734/b8226709-4ec9-4864-a43d-13de204465e0.jpeg\" alt=\"raphael_jambalos profile image\" loading=\"lazy\">\n      </a>\n      <a href=\"/raphael_jambalos\">\n        <span class=\"comment-username\">Raphael Jambalos</span>\n      </a>\n      <span class=\"color-base-30 px-2\" role=\"presentation\">•</span>\n\n<a href=\"https://dev.to/raphael_jambalos/comment/1ccjb\" class=\"comment-date crayons-link crayons-link--secondary fs-s\">\n  <time datetime=\"2021-03-14T01:15:53Z\">\n    Mar 14\n  </time>\n\n</a>\n\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"body\">\n      <p>I agree with your points, Abdul.

Verify after every small change that the code is still working as it should. Automated tests are incredibly useful for this.<br>\nIf you try to make multiple changes at once, it's easier to lose sight of what could be affected. Also, the combination of multiple changes will result in an exponential number of issues that can be caused.</p>\n\n<p>One of the best and easiest way to refactor is to rename and move things. Learn the hotkey of your IDE to rename variables, classes, functions and files. It will make the code much more understandable for the next developer (or yourself after a few weeks)</p>\n\n\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Thanks for sharing how you stay fit, <a class=\"comment-mentioned-user\" href=\"https://dev.to/manpreet\">@manpreet</a>\n!
