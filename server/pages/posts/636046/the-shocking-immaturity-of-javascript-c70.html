tags: js, codenewbies, beginners</p><h2>cover_image: <a target="_blank" href="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pd5d1n04lgg2jcrtqwz4.jpg">https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pd5d1n04lgg2jcrtqwz4.jpg</a></h2><p>This is going to come across as a rant, so I&#x27;ll do my best to refrain from blaming any one project or source and just make a generalized statement.</p><p><strong>The ecosystem of JavaScript frameworks is almost unbelievably unstable.</strong> Yes, even now in the year 2021.</p><p>From backend ORMs and headless APIs to frontend site generators, package managers, and build toolsâ€”it&#x27;s a miracle any of it actually works properly in production!</p><p>Some weeks I spend literally <em>hours</em> debugging and researching all kinds of weird, arcane bugs or conceptual hurdles related to performance, hosting, payload sizes, full-stack architectural gotchas, and the list goes on and on and on. And it&#x27;s not just me. I&#x27;m on a team that is in a constant mode of struggle and churn due to dealing with largely obvious issues related to the most popular tools for backend &amp; frontend JavaScript (at least according to their massive star counts on GitHub).</p><p>Now the reason this really grinds my gears isn&#x27;t just related to my particular project. In a purely cynical sense, what do I care? I&#x27;m getting paid the same whether I&#x27;m writing code or debugging it.</p><p>The thing that bothers me is how awful of an experience this is for people with <em>far</em> less experience than me. I&#x27;ve been in this industry for over 20 years. However, other people are attempting to get into web development <strong>this year</strong>. And they&#x27;re being told in order to do so they have to learn X, Y, and Z toolsâ€¦all JavaScript of course. The problem is if they run into major issuesâ€”and they do, believe me, they doâ€”they don&#x27;t know enough to grasp just how buggy and incomplete the tooling is. Instead, they think they must have just made a mistake, or simply haven&#x27;t learned enough yet. The cognitive load required is staggering.</p><p>Or perhaps they haven&#x27;t run into too many issues yet. (Lucky!) That&#x27;s possible, because <em>the vast majority</em> of tutorials and examples out there for the top JavaScript frameworks are laughably simplistic. If I see yet another example of how to use a GraphQL query to pull a blog post from a headless CMS to statically render an article using a component tree built with You-Know-What.js, I&#x27;m going to rip my hair out of my skull. This isn&#x27;t where any real-world applications of any reasonable size get tripped up. The devil is <em>always</em> in the details. The problems typically arise well beyond the scope of clickbait-y &quot;Build THIS in 10 minutes&quot; articles.</p><h3>How Do We Fix This?</h3><p>The path to correcting any sort of systemic problem is to first acknowledge it and then to define its scope with honest and sober reflection.</p><p>We all need to start being forthcoming about just how shockingly buggy and incomplete most of the JavaScript tooling is across the board. <em>Compared to what</em>, you might ask? Maybe this is just an artifact of web development, period. It&#x27;s the nature of the beast.</p><p><strong>Wrong.</strong> You can hop the fence over to other programming languages, frameworks, and ecosystems, and discover that the tooling there is <strong>far more stable and usable</strong> over the long haul. I don&#x27;t wish to turn this into a pitch for Ruby, but let&#x27;s just say in my many years of <em>extensive engagement</em> with the Rails framework and related projects, I&#x27;ve never encountered the sheer volume of bugs, glitches, gotchas, and limitations which I encounter <em>on a regular basis</em> in JS land. And it&#x27;s not just meâ€¦I&#x27;m in chat rooms and Twitter threads all the time where other folks are losing their minds over some latest craziness. All we can do is shake our heads and go take a walk or something to relieve the pressure.</p><p>So how do we fix this? Here&#x27;s one suggestion:</p><h3>Start Telling the Truth</h3><p>Get off the off-the-charts hype machine, stat. Enough with hyperbolic statements like &quot;this is the modern way to build the web&quot; or &quot;this gives you the best developer experience with all the features you need for production&quot; or &quot;write high quality, loosely coupled, scalable, maintainable applications the most productive way&quot;. (These are all real quotes, BTW.) The constant marketing is not only exhausting, it also feeds newbies a bunch of malarkey.</p><p>Start by being honest about what <em>doesn&#x27;t</em> work as much as what does work. Warn people about building battle-hardened, production-level code on top of your buggy and incomplete foundations. Steer people towards other, better solutionsâ€”even other languages and frameworksâ€”if you know your tool-du-jour isn&#x27;t quite up to snuff yet. Slow down your progress on shiny new features and fix the features you&#x27;ve already shipped.</p><p>Label releases and techniques properly. It&#x27;s perfectly serviceable to have something in alpha or beta state for quite some time, or to say a particular technique is probably only suitable for the stout-hearted with time to kill. Also, stop with the &quot;old-school code&quot; shaming. The world isn&#x27;t going to end if you write something in a manner that&#x27;s been proven to work for several years by now, rather than the &quot;flavor-of-the-month&quot; according to some code-school blog. We snicker at one person&#x27;s <code>var</code> or another person&#x27;s <code>$.get</code> to fix the fire extinguisher and meanwhile the house is on fire.</p><h3>Feel the Users&#x27; Pain</h3><p>This all mainly boils down to something we learn in the world of UX (User Experience) designâ€”you have to feel the pain your users go through when they use your software. In the case of developer tools, developers are the users! That&#x27;s why the term DX (Developer Experience) gets thrown around a lot now. The thing is, good DX isn&#x27;t just some whiz-bang <em>ooo, that&#x27;s cool</em> reaction to a new blog post. It&#x27;s &quot;how well will this work for me and my team over the next several years??!&quot; In that sense, the DX of the JavaScript ecosystem has a <em>lot</em> to answer for. Sometimes you even see it in GitHub issue and PR comments: rude, curt dismissals of genuine problems people are having in the real world. RTFM is <em>never</em> the correct response to DX issues.</p><p>Again, I come from the world of Rubyâ€”not perfect by any means. But we have a saying, MINASWAN, which stands for Matz-is-nice-and-so-we-are-nice. In other words, the creator of Ruby (known as Matz) is in most respects a pretty genteel fellow. So let&#x27;s also be nice and help out our fellow developers, particularly the newbies. That doesn&#x27;t just mean in terms of sharing ideas or providing education. It means <em>the tools we build should themselves be pretty nice!</em> Crappy code smell and lousy DX often gets called out in the Ruby community because we&#x27;ve been handed a high bar. Name your variables well. Reduce boilerplate. Use a small surface area for your API whenever possible. Cultivate well-organized codebases. Convention over configuration. Maximize programmer happiness. And so on and so forth.</p><p>The result of all this is I sometimes look at the bugs or issues with I deal with when using JavaScript tooling and my initial reaction is: <strong>this would <em>never</em> fly in Ruby</strong>. Developers would simply laugh and quickly move on to a better tool. I&#x27;m not saying this to prop up Ruby. I&#x27;m saying this to convince you that <em>you need to demand more of your JS tools</em>.</p><p><strong>Demand more stability.</strong></p><p><strong>Demand more clarity.</strong></p><p><strong>Demand more honesty and less marketing fluff.</strong></p><p><strong>Demand higher standards.</strong> (Heck, demand standards at all! The ecosystem churn around ES modules right now is driving even the top authors of frontend bundlers absolutely nuts!)</p><p><strong>Stop putting up with the nonsense.</strong> The excuses have run out. How long have we had Node? How long has ES6+ JavaScript been with us? How long have we had other, more stable ecosystems to be inspired by?</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>You might conclude, after such a rant, that I hate JavaScript and just want to leave. Actually, I don&#x27;t! ðŸ˜… There are JS projects I <em>love</em> which offer great APIs in my opinion. <a target="_blank" href="https://lit-element.polymer-project.org">LitElement</a> for example is one of the best developer tools I&#x27;ve ever used in any language. Native ESM support in browsers and modern CDNs like SkyPack are wildly exciting. I&#x27;ve actually written a Webpack plugin and found the experience enjoyable. In fact, unlike some fellow Rails devs I know, I rather like configuring Webpack. (Now who&#x27;s the crazy one?!) PostCSS is a nifty Node project I benefit from every day. <a target="_blank" href="https://shoelace.style">Shoelace web components</a> are the bees&#x27; knees.</p><p>So I don&#x27;t hate JS. I don&#x27;t hate frontend engineering, and I don&#x27;t hate Node. What I hate is developer tools with awful DX due to hacks upon hacks upon endless modules of widely-varying quality as a result of constant churn in &quot;best practices&quot; and what&#x27;s compatible with what, where, when. I simply no longer have the patience to deal.</p><p>Thus I&#x27;m begging youâ€”<em>imploring you</em>â€”if you build or maintain any tool in the JS ecosystem, pause for a moment and consider how you can reorient yourself around upping the long-term quality level of the tools you produce. And if you are a newbie, DEMAND your tools give you the quality you deserve. And if you <em>do</em> work on a tool that&#x27;s actually pretty stable, fun to work with, and hasn&#x27;t tried to take over the world with ridiculous claimsâ€”<em>kudos to you!</em> <strong>You&#x27;re breathing rarified air.</strong> ðŸ˜œ</p></div></div><div class="flex flex-wrap mt-16 mb-8"><div class="w-full md:w-1/2 py-4 pr-4"><h2 class="text-primary font-bold

And if you _do_ work on a tool that's actually pretty stable, fun to work with, and hasn't tried to take over the world with ridiculous claimsâ€”_kudos to you!_ **You're breathing rarified air.** ðŸ˜œ","user":{"name":"Jared White","username":"jaredcwhite","twitter_username":"jaredcwhite","github_username":"jaredcwhite","website_url":"https://www.bridgetownrb.com","profile_image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--80J3wLB7--/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,h_640,q_auto,w_640/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/profile_image/342525/21d42783-97b3-41d1-a778-d30c3120690a.jpg","profile_image_90":"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bZJq9nCl--/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,h_90,q_auto,w_90/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/profile_image/342525/21d42783-97b3-41d1-a778-d30c3120690a.jpg"},"readingTime":"8 min read"}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts/[id]/[slug]","query":{"id":"636046","slug":"the-shocking-immaturity-of-javascript-c70"},"buildId":"JVa0_A4UchlqVz3_lHyL7","nextExport":false,"isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"head":[["meta",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width"}],["meta",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["title",{"children":"The Shocking Immaturity of JavaScript"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"The Shocking Immaturity of JavaScript"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"undefined/posts/636046/the-shocking-immaturity-of-javascript-c70"}],["meta",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"The Shocking Immaturity of JavaScript"}],["meta",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"Do code newbies realize just how shockingly buggy and incomplete all the tools they use really are?"}]]}</script><script nomodule="" src="/_next/static/chunks/polyfills-05d6b25b3c33d28a7267.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/main-91d73c3d220e9e82c85b.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/webpack-e067438c4cf4ef2ef178.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/framework.53cfa66f9846f4090096.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/05d954cf.88227f8f7ef054da8faf.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/07129fa77f814cd02d37a53e474b399a7c218e2f.73621539fd8284f638e2.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/08b59f0b1d622d8900460b3f85dd32f6b6670c32.07986f0a3d4c7b96ee1d.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/_app-1465e098bf137674edee.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/6fbdb19ab300a5fed78b8472a5ef84b0fc552338.cbb626f862260505adbe.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/6a65758fc9fd76acefbdcbeef2428ef4b415fe22.ce8ca5c777032eab3e06.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/posts/%5Bid%5D/%5Bslug%5D-60ab1b9300b5411eb8c2.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/JVa0_A4UchlqVz3_lHyL7/_buildManifest.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/JVa0_A4UchlqVz3_lHyL7/_ssgManifest.js" async=""></script></body></html>
